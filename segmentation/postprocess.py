    How it works:
        The overlap matrix is a lookup table of the area of intersection
        between each set of labels (true and predicted). The true labels
        are taken to be along axis 0, and the predicted labels are taken 
        to be along axis 1. The sum of the overlaps along axis 0 is thus
        an array giving the total overlap of the true labels with each of
        the predicted labels, and likewise the sum over axis 1 is the
        total overlap of the predicted labels with each of the true labels.
        Because the label 0 (background) is included, this sum is guaranteed
        to reconstruct the total area of each label. Adding this row and
        column vectors gives a 2D array with the areas of every label pair
        added together. This is equivalent to the union of the label areas
        except for the duplicated overlap area, so the overlap matrix is
        subtracted to find the union matrix.
